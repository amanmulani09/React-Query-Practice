Here is the step by step guide of my notes while learning react-query

1. => install the package using npm i @tanstack/react-query and devtools by i @tanstack/react-query-devtools

2 => import query client and query-client provider and wrap it 
        on the application create a client instant by calling queryClient constructor and pass it to the provider to client prop;
//here is the boiler plate code

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { QueryClient,QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
)

3 => in react query we can do two major things 


1. Query => getting data from somewhere
2. Mutation => changing some typeof data

ex getting list of posts[query],create a brand new post[mutation];

there are two hooks useQuery, useMutation which used to get data and change data 

it does invalidate with very nice way

i can use the userClient query to invalitdate the data when i mutate it
